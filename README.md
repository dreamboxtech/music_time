## Project Details
Music time is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings 
of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists 
and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

The app uses data models to power the API endpoints for the site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database 
for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on the site.

## Stack:
#### Backend
- SQLAlchemy ORM to be ORM library of choice
- PostgreSQL as database 
- Python3 and Flask as server language and server framework
- Flask-Migrate for creating and running schema migrations

#### Frontend:
